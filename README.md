# Alumni-Connect
> A "Piazza"-like social media portal.

## Introduction

Before COVID-19 we had tons of resources for face-to-face connection between alumni and students. But now "quarantine" is our best friend.\
We want to narrow the distance between people, especially for the NYU alumni and students. For that purpose, our team has decided to build a web application which is a social media platform where all NYU alumni can share their daily life, release ads, reach out for help, or whatever else they'd like to.

## Objectives
Provide an easy to use application that users can share their information with others.\
Enable users to browse other users' post and make comment below it.\
Allow users to chat privately with other users.\
Provide a fancy web interface.
## Application Features and Description
All NYU alumni can sign up by their net id. 
You can make a post here by typing short statements about what you’re doing/what’s going on in your world/your opinion on something topical.
Like twitter, the basic way to get in touch with others is that you “follow people” and have people “follow you”. 
When you make a post, your followers see it, and you can also browse the posts of people who you’re following.
If you want to communicate with people without it being public, you can send short private messages.
